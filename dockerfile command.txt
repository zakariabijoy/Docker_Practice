FROM: used to pull image from docker hud
	FROM <image>:<tag> as <name>
	ex : FROM httpd:alpine as base

COPY: to copy files from one to another destination 
	COPY <scr> <dest>
	ex:COPY ./html/ /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
	ex2: COPY --from=base /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ /app/    (one image to another image)
	
WORKDIR: make a path a root or main directory as workdirectory in container
	ex: WORKDIR /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/    => . (now we can use . instead of /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ )
	ex2: 	WORKDIR /a
			WORKDIR b
			WORKDIR c
			RUN pwd
			
			The output of the final pwd command in this Dockerfile would be /a/b/c.
